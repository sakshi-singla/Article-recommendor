# Article-recommendor

The goal of this project is to learn how to make a simple article recommendation engine using a semi-recent advance in natural language processing called word2vec. In particular, we're going to use a "database" from Stanford's GloVe project trained on Wikipedia. The project involves reading in a database of word vectors and a corpus of text articles then organizing them into a handy table (list of lists) for processing.

Around the recommendation engine, built a web server that displays a list of BBC articles for URL http://localhost:5000 (testing) or whatever the IP address is of your Amazon server (deployment)



Clicking on one of those articles takes you to an article page that shows the text of the article as well as a list of five recommended articles
